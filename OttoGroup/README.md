This directory includes the code I used to run experiments for the competition.  I started very late (with only a few days remaining) so I didn't have much time to experiment, but I messed around with xgboost and keras (deep learning library) a bit.<br/>

I used the Anaconda distribution of Python with the IPython kernel and PyCharm IDE to run experiments, with some additional dependencies configured like a decent BLAS for Theano.  The primary script is otto.py.  The others are example scripts I got from various places.<br/>
