# Parameters
XGB_WEIGHT = 0.6500
BASELINE_WEIGHT = 0.0056

BASELINE_PRED = 0.0115

# version 61
#   Drop fireplacecnt and fireplaceflag, following Jayaraman:
#     https://www.kaggle.com/valadi/xgb-w-o-outliers-lgb-with-outliers-combo-tune5

# version 60
#   Try BASELINE_PRED=0.0115, since that's the actual baseline from
#     https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/oleg-s-original-better-baseline

# version 59
#   Looks like 0.0056 is the optimum BASELINE_WEIGHT

# versions 57, 58
#   Playing with BASELINE_WEIGHT parameter:
#     3 values will determine quadratic approximation of optimum

# version 55
#   OK, it doesn't get the same result, but I also get a different result
#     if I fork the earlier version and run it again.
#   So something weird is going on (maybe software upgrade??)
#   I'm just going to submit this version and make it my new benchmark.

# version 53
#   Re-parameterize ensemble (should get same result).

# version 51
#   Quadratic approximation based on last 3 submissions gives 0.3533
#     as optimal lgb_weight.  To be slightly conservative,
#     I'm rounding down to 0.35

# version 50
#   Quadratic approximation based on last 3 submissions gives 0.3073 
#     as optimal lgb_weight

# version 49
#   My latest quadratic approximation is concave, so I'm just taking
#     a shot in the dark with lgb_weight=.3

# version 45
#   Increase lgb_weight to 0.25 based on new quadratic approximation.
#   Based on scores for versions 41, 43, and 44, the optimum is 0.261
#     if I've done the calculations right.
#   I'm being conservative and only going 2/3 of the way there.
#   (FWIW my best guess is that even this will get a worse score,
#    but you gotta pay some attention to the math.)

# version 44
#   Increase lgb_weight to 0.23, per Nikunj's suggestion, even though
#     my quadratic approximation said I was already at the optimum

# verison 43
#   Higher lgb_weight, so I can do a quadratic approximation of the optimum

# version 42
#   The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything
#     comes down to a slightly higher lgb_weight

# version 41
#   Trying Nikunj's suggestion of imputing missing values.

# version 39
#   Trying higher lgb_weight again but with old learning rate.
#   The new one did better with LGB only but makes the combination worse.

# version 38
#   OK back to baseline 0.2 weight

# version 37
#   Looks like increasing lgb_weight was better

# version 34
#   OK, try reducing lgb_weight instead

# version 32
#   Increase lgb_weight because LGB performance has imporved more than XGB
#   Increase learning rate for LGB: 0029 is compromise;  CV prefers 0033
#     (and reallly would prefer more boosting rounds with old value instead
#      but constaints on running time are getting hard)

# Version 27:
#   Control LightGBM's loquacity

# Version 26:
# Getting rid of the LightGBM validation, since this script doesn't use the result.
# Now use all training data to fit model.
# I have a separate script for validation:
#    https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/lightgbm-outliers-remaining-cv
